      <h3>Ties</h3>
      <p>In music theory, a tie is a small, curved line which connects two notes of the same pitch. The time values of tied notes are added together â€“ the note is only played once.</p>

      <p>Ties are usually written on the opposite side of a musical note to its stem. If the stems are up, the tie is placed underneath the notes. If the stems are down, the tie is drawn above the notes.</p>

      <p>Ties can cross bar lines.</p>

      <h3>Example:</h3>

      <img src="../../images/theory/th10ml02.png" alt="Tied Crotchets">

      <p>Here we have four crotchets in a bar of 4/4 time. The first note has been tied to the second note. Crotchets 3 and 4 are also tied. The first crotchet is played and is then held for the duration of the tied note (2nd beat) as well.</p>

      <p>Remember: Only the first note is played in tied notes, but it lasts as long as both notes put together.</p>

      <p>The following bar will sound exactly the same as the previous bar even though it looks rather different.</p>
